            <h2>  <b>Moon Gardens</b> </h2> <br>
              <p> Moon gardens can be an enchanting addition to a small area where you
                spend evening hours, like a porch or patio. <br><br>

                Essentially, any large, white
                flower that picks up low light is appropriate, but some flowers like the classic
                moonflower and four o' clock only bloom at night. <br><br>

              <p> The Devil's Trumpet, or Datura plant is sometimes called a moonflower, however, it's quite different than the
                climbing flower that ascends trellises. The datura is an extermely poisonous plant with hallucinagenic
                properties. Due to its huge, white bloom it is perfect for a moongarden that is kept away from animals and
                children. The hallucinagenic expirence that can occur - sometimes even from deeply sniffing the flower -
                 is said to not be pleasurable, but rather more like a Hellish waking nightmare. Some South American tribes have used the plant
                 as a punishment for naughty children. It has also been used in Witchcraft along with The Angel's Trumpet, Brugmansia as a
                flying potion as it induces powerful "hallucinations" of flying...
                It can be propogated by seed (the pods of which look like medival maces) though, I have not had much luck, myself, my mom
                has been able to get them to germinate. Strangly, I have found them for sale at Pink Grizzly Nursery in Missoula labeled simply
                as Moon Flowers.
                <img src="./imgs/brugmansia.jpg">
                Angel's Trumpets, or Brugmansia is also highly poisonous. Thier scent is extremely sweet. I didn't really understand the meaning of
                "cloying" until I had one on my patio. Named so because its trumpet shaped blooms dangle from above rather that shoot up from below,
                the Angel's Trumpet also possesses a huge, white bloom suitable for night enjoyment and sickeningly sweet scent isn't released until nightfall.
                The sweet name and scent is deceptive, though; it's just as deadly poisonous as the Devil's Trumpet.
                <img src="./imgs/casablanca.jpg">
                The Casablanca Lily is an innocuous alternative to these gorgerous, chunky flowers for those with curious pets or children.
                Other good choices for night gardens are: evening scented stock, evening primrose, and flowering tobacco.
