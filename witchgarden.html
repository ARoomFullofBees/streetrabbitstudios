              <b>Witch Gardens</b> </h3>
              <p> All gardens are potentially Witch Gardens, however, there are certain plants
                 that are traditional staples of the craft. <br><br><br>
                 <img src="./imgs/foxglove.jpg">
                 <p> <h3>Foxglove</h3> Foxglove or Digitalis is now an important ingredient in modern heart medications, it has
                 a rich history and connection to the faery realm and is also extremely poisonous. It is also particularly beautiful,
                  with bell shaped flowers growing on willowy stalks. It's a lovely way to add color and interest to corners, as it's a shade-loving plant. <br><br><br>


<img src="./imgs/belladonna.jpg">
                 <H3>Deadly Nightshade</H3> Deadly Nightshade, aka Belladonna, is a powerful divination plant, however, it's unwise to
                  use in ingestables, as it's extremely poisonous. It has medicial uses - usually
                   to induce sleep or help with bronchitis. It was also used in Italy for cosmetic purposes - to dialate the eyes of
                   beautiful women.<br><br><br>

          <h3>Vervain</h3> Vervain, usually called Verbena in modern times, is used for beauty and protection spells and to enhance nearly any spell. It's a witchcraft staple. <br><br><br>
<img src="./imgs/lobelia.jpg"> <br><br><br>
          <h3> Lobelia </h3> Lobelia, which symbolizes hate and ill-will, is extremely popular in the United States as a filler for hanging baskets. It has a long-standing tradion in the arts and an excellent offering for Hecate. <br><br><br>
          <img src="./imgs/mugwort.jpg">

                           <h3>Mugwort</h3> Mugwort is an extremely useful herb for
                            astral travel, psychic awareness, banishing, and cursing. Harmful if ingested in large amounts, it should be
                            only used in sachets and burning in ventillated areas. <br>
